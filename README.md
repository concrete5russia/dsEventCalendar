dsEventCalendar
================

Description
----
My first official package for Concrete 5 - Event Calendar.
It is simple add on to create calendar with events and display it on page as block.

I have created some templates - red, blue, green. You can create own theme - just edit CSS or (better) SCSS! Each template has compass project for styles (on branch dev).

At now I use this calendar script:

Maybe in future I create something own with new features.

How to use
----
First, go to dashboard and add calendar in "Add / edit calendar" . After that you can create new event in "Add / edit event" connected with new added calendar (choose from select).

If you did this, go to page and add new block called "Event Calendar" and select calendar.

If you want, you can change template in Custom Templates.
